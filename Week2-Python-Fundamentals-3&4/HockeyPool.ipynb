        "Object oriented programming (OOP) is a set of toosl for organizing code so that you can find problems quickly.  Python supports object oriented programming and The Python Tutorial is one of the best ways to learn Python.  The Python Tutorial is is one of the best tutorials of any programming language.  Week 2 part 1 of this course covers material from:\n",

        "# Working an Example: An Office Hockey Pool\n",
        "Office or school hockey pools are common but they can be a fair amount of work to run.  Excel can be used to automate things but when spreadsheets get very large they can be difficult to work with.  A properly designed Python program is usually easier to build and maintain than a very large spreadsheet.  There are many websites that commercially sell automated hockey pools that are programmed similarly to this worked example.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Each competitor must form a hockey team by choosing three forwards, two defencemen, and a goalie play on their fantasy team.\n",
        "1. When a player on a competitor's team scores a goal for their real-life NHL team that competitor's fantasy team is credited with the goal.  The same goes for assists, goals, and fights.\n",
        "1. A team's score is the sum of the scores of the individual players.\n",
        "1. A forward's score is equal to twice the number of goals plus the number of assists.\n",
        "1. A defenceman's score is equal to twice the number of fights they win plus the number of assists.\n",
        "1. A goalie's score is equal to the number of saves they make divided by two.\n",
        "1. Each player must be assigned a unique number.\n",
        "1. The players must have silly names.  Did you know that Python is named after a comedy television show?  It helps to have a sense of humour.\n",

That's 4 million lines of code per year and after 10 years that's 40 million lines of code.  By holding Page-Down and letting the text flow by like in \"The Matrix\" it would take 11 hours before you reached the bottom.  Imagine there's a problem.  How are you ever going to find it?
